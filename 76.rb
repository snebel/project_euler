# It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:
#
# 4 + 1
# 3 + 2
# 3 + 1 + 1
# 2 + 2 + 1
# 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
# 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
#
# How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least
# two positive integers?
#
# My Notes: 
# - We can use the same code as Problem 31 (summing coins to Â£2), only now our
#   "coin" values are the numbers 1 to 99 and our total is 100
# - I had to go back to problem 31 and rewrite the code to use memoization for
#   this much larger input to avoid millions of recalculations. Runs in ~13ms
