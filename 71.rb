# By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d â‰¤ 1,000,000 in ascending order
# of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
#
# My Notes:
# - We can use Ruby's Rational class to handle reducing fractions 
# - For each divisor, d, we can find the rational closest to but less than 3/7 by
#   setting the numerator to d*3 / 7 with integer division.
# - We can list these rationals for all possible divisors and grab the largest one

# for each divisor, find the fraction closest to 3/7
